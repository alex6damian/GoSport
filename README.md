## 📖 About the Project

This project represents my bachelor’s thesis and aims to develop a functional prototype for a sports-focused video streaming and news aggregation platform. Users can select their favorite sports, follow content creators, and receive a personalized feed of news and videos.

Main technical challenges addressed:
- **Video Transcoding:** Asynchronous processing using FFmpeg for HLS delivery (Adaptive Bitrate Streaming).
- **Full-Text Search:** Fast news indexing using Meilisearch.
- **Scalability:** Modular architecture designed with containerization in mind.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system is built using a modular monolithic architecture (with the possibility of being split into microservices), separating video processing (CPU-intensive workloads) from the main API.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Component | Technology | Role |
|----------|------------|------|
| **Backend** | Go + Fiber | REST API, Business Logic, Auth (JWT) |
| **Worker** | Go + FFmpeg | Video processing, HLS generation, Thumbnails |
| **Frontend** | React + hls.js | User interface and video player |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL | Persistent storage (users, metadata, feed) |
| **Storage** | MinIO | S3-compatible object storage for video files |
| **Search** | Meilisearch | Search engine for news and transcripts |
| **Metrics** | Prometheus | Monitoring and observability |

## ✨ Key Features (MVP)

### 🎥 Streaming & Video
- **Upload:** Video uploads using presigned URLs to MinIO.
- **Processing:** Automatic transcoding to HLS format for adaptive streaming.
- **Playback:** Custom video player based on `hls.js`.
- **Interactions:** Likes and subscriptions to content creators.

### 📰 Sports News
- **Ingestion:** Automatic aggregation from external sources (RSS / APIs).
- **Personalization:** News filtering based on user-selected sports.
- **Search:** Ultra-fast article indexing and search.

### 🔐 Users
- Secure authentication and profile management.
- Creator dashboard (uploaded content management).
